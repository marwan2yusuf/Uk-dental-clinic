                    We know that a healthy mouth—especially the teeth, lips and tongue—is essential for speech and
                    affects our ability to taste, chew, and digest foods. We also know that poor oral health—such as
                    chronic inflammation from gum disease—has been associated with heart disease, blockages, and
                    strokes.

                    Research even suggests that a healthy mouth may help prevent pre-term births and low birth-weight
                    babies, and help us prevent memory loss in later years of life.

                    We are committed to helping you maintain your oral health as an integral part of your overall health
                    and wellness.</p>

                    We provide team-based, comprehensive dental care for children and adults, including patients of all
                    ages who are anxious or have an underlying developmental or medical condition that may add
                    complexity to the management of their oral health.

                    Care is provided by University of Minnesota School of Dentistry faculty members and by dental,
                    dental therapy, dental hygiene students and/or dentists pursuing advanced education. All student
                    caregivers treat patients under supervision by School of Dentistry faculty. Patients with advanced
                    oral health and care needs may be treated in our specialty or advanced care clinics.
